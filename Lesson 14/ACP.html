        <h3 class="text-danger">No pain, no gain.<br><br></h3>
        <p>Patients often ask me if that adage is true when it comes to exercising and athletic activity. <br><br>In general, do need to push yourself to some level of discomfort to make gains in strength or cardiovascular fitness.People who are sedentary are familiar with stiffness or soreness that may linger for a day or two after exercising. These are normal responses to using muscles that are unaccustomed to a particular activity.</p> 
        <dl>
            <dt>Push past point of discomfort.</dt>
            <dd>1)People who do exercise regularly know well that feeling of burning or fatigue in their muscles when they push a little harder than they are comfortable with 
            <dd>2)Here’s what’s happening in your body. When you push a muscle to work beyond its ability to use oxygen delivered in the blood, you’re creating lactic acid, which gives you that burning sensation.</dd>
            <dd>3)It’s what exercise-experienced people usually recognize as a really good fatigue, or a good workout.</dd>
            <dd>The production of lactic acid actually plays a role in creating more blood flow to the muscles so that you gain more strength and endurance next time.</dd>
            <dd class="mark"><u>So, yes, no pain, no gain is true for activities such as running, swimming or lifting weights.</u></dd>

            <li>Cardiovascular gains are a little different. The heart can get stronger and more efficient at less than maximum fatigue.</li>
            <li>If your heart is beating temporarily at a faster heart rate — say in moderate walking or slow jogging — you will not feel pain. Your heart muscle still benefits a great deal.</li>
            <li>If you’re middle aged, however, and you begin to feel pain in your chest while exercising, we want you to slow down. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among Americans age 35 and older.</li>
            <li>If you’re younger than that and you feel chest pain, it’s very unlikely to be a heart problem. Still, it’s a good idea to be cautious, and if you’re at all concerned, talk to your doctor</li>

        <h2 class="text-primary">When you should stop</h2>
        <p>Although I’m saying you should feel some burning or fatigue to make gains in strength and endurance, certain types of pain may be a warning signal to stop. They include:A severe <abbr title="Visit the doctor if the symptoms get worse or are serious"> or sharp pain during a workout. This indicates that something is stressed, inflamed, damaged or sensitive.</abbr> Do not push through it.A pain that feels as if tissue is being pulled apart when stretching. Stretch only to the point where you feel a slight pain, hold it, push a bit more and release.</p>
