            <h1>My journey as a web developer</h1>
            <p>"I didn’t start out knowing I’d be a web developer, but the curiosity was always there. What began as simple edits to HTML templates eventually turned into a deep dive into the world of front-end and back-end development. Over time, I taught myself how to build responsive websites, connect APIs, and bring interactive ideas to life — one line of code at a time.Along the way, I’ve experimented with multiple frameworks, picked up design principles, and worked on real-world projects that challenged both my logic and creativity. What I love most is the constant evolution — there's always something new to learn, a better way to solve a problem, or a more elegant design to implement.<p>
            <p>Today, I build clean, functional websites and web apps, with a focus on performance, accessibility, and user experience. I see web development not just as a career, but as a craft — and I’m always working to sharpen it."</p>
            <p>Now, I focus on creating clean, scalable, and user-focused web applications. Whether it’s a landing page, a dashboard, or a full-stack app, I aim to build solutions that are thoughtful, efficient, and enjoyable to use.Web development has taught me more than just code — it’s taught me how to learn, how to iterate, and how to keep growing. I'm still exploring, still building, and still just getting started.</p>
